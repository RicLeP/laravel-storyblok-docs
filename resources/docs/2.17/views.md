- [Using includes](#using-includes)
- [The render() method](#the-render-method)


You can loop over the nested Blocks in your Blade template, optionally using `@@include` to pass the data to child views to keep things manageable and reusable as shown below. This lets you quickly build your pages but does limit some of the dynamic nature of being able to create pages in Storyblok using nested components, see the `render()` method below.

> {info} You can quickly scaffold all your component views by running `artisan ls:stub-views`. Use `artisan ls:stub-views -O` to overwrite your current Blade files.

```php
@extends('storyblok._layout')


@section('content')
	<main>
		<swiper :options="swiperHero">
			@foreach($story->feature_heroes as $featureHero)
				<swiper-slide>
					@include('storyblok.blocks._feature-hero', ['featureHero' => $featureHero])
				</swiper-slide>
			@endforeach
		</swiper>

		<section class="home-introduction u-w-narrowest u-w--centred">
			<h1 class="t-3 fgc-ocean">{{ $story->title }}</h1>

			<div>
				<p class="u-mb-30 t-8">{{ $story->introduction }}</p>

				<div>
					@foreach($story->buttons as $button)
						<a href="{{ url($button->url->cached_url) }}" class="button">
                            {{ $button->text }}
                        </a>
					@endforeach
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<div class="section-teasers">
			@foreach($story->teasers as $teaser)
				@include('storyblok.blocks._section-teaser', ['teaser' => $teaser])
			@endforeach
		</div>

		<section class="interview-teasers u-w-widest u-w--centred u-w--m-flush u-mt-100 u-mb-100">
			<h4 class="t-6 interview-teasers__title">Real world advice and inspiration</h4>

			@foreach($story->interviews as $interview)
				@include('storyblok.blocks._interview-teaser', ['interview' => $interview])
			@endforeach
		</section>

		<section class="u-w-wide u-w--centred u-mb-180">
			<header class="home-events u-mb-35">
				<h2 class="t-2 fgc-ocean u-mr-10 u-mb-10">Upcoming IoD events</h2>
				<a href="{{ route('events') }}" class="t-4 link-underlined link-ocean">See all events</a>
			</header>

			<event-list :limit="2"></event-list>
		</section>
	</main>
@endsection

```

<a name="using-includes">
## Example using includes
</a>

```php
@extends('layouts._default')

@section('content')
	<main>
		@foreach($story->features as $feature)
			<section>
				<h2>
					{{ $feature->title }}
				</h2>

				@foreach($feature->body as $section)
					@include('storyblok.blocks._' . $section->component(), ['block' => $section])
				@endforeach
			</section>
		@endforeach
		</div>
	</main>
@endsection
```


<a name="the-render-method">
## The `render()` method
</a>

Alternatively a block can render itself by implementing the `Renderable` trait and calling the `render()` method. This will look for a view matching the Blocks name and pass the content to it.

```php
@extends('layouts._default')

@section('content')
	<main>
		@foreach($story->features as $feature)
			<section>
				<h2>
					{{ $feature->title }}
				</h2>

				@foreach($feature->body as $section)
					$section->render()
				@endforeach
			</section>
		@endforeach
		</div>
	</main>
@endsection
```

You can send additional content to the Blade view rendered by passing an array to the `render()` method.

```php

$block->render(['some_content' => 'some value'])

// Usage in the Blockâ€™s Blade
{{ $some_content }}
```

**Since 2.12.1**

If you wish to use a specific view for rendering the Block use the `$block->renderUsing('pass.view.name')` method. You can pass an array of views and the first matching one will be used. Additional content can be passed by supplying an array for the second argument: `$block->renderUsing('pass.view.name', ['extra' => 'content])`.
